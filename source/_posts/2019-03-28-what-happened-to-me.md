Has it been almost three years since my last blog post ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?

Up until the very beginning of 2016 i was mostly doing .Net Development using frameworks such as _Microsoft WebAPI_, _Microsoft ASP.NET MVC_. But years before that, an itch developed.

Around 2012 my interest grew into **dynamic languages** and i started to experiment and play with Ruby. If i look back, i think it was mostly the fact that it felt so weird to lay a typed contract over a dynamic format like JSON.

On the other hand our codebases started to grow on the client side. We were using frameworks like _JQuery_ and _JQuery.Ui_ to make things more ux friendly. In the end it looked like we had to create a controller in Javascript to keep it well structured.

In the beginning of 2016 i got the opportunity to become lead of a new project for a client. The choice was made to build it entirely using Javascript, by using _Angular.JS_ for the frontend and _NODE.JS_ for backend.

**I never looked back**, now my preferred stack is _React.JS_ and _Node.JS_ on the back-end and decided to pick up blogging again!

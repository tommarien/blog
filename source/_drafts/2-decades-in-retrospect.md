In the spring of '99, softwired to be 1999 (**Y2K**), my career started as a _Visual Basic for Applications_ developer. While i am writing this down i can hear your mockery! The company used _Microsoft Access_ as **RAD** tool, to build invoicing software on demand. After a miscommunication about working hours (max. 8 per day ðŸ˜¤) and contractual disagreement this ended abruptly.

Returned to the job market and after a surprising job interview, i got hired as a **support/network** engineer. After a couple of courses and with some help of very skilled colleagues, i managed to maintain networks for about 2 years, where i did general support, wiring and setups of _Windows NT 4_ networks. Although i was a weird jump as a software developer, i still reap the benefits from this period.

But the "itch" got worse, i talked to my manager and convinced him to give me a position as a _Visual Basic_ Developer in his _Visual FoxPro_ development unit.

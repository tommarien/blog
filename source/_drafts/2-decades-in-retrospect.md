In the spring of '99, softwired to be 1999 (**Y2K**), my career started as a _Visual Basic for Applications_ developer. The company used _Microsoft Access_ as **RAD** tool, to build invoicing software on demand. After a "miscommunication" about working hours (max. 8 per day) and contractual disagreement this ended abruptly.

Returned to the job market and after a surprising job interview, i got hired as a **support/network** engineer. After a couple of courses and with the help of very skilled colleagues, i managed to maintain networks for about 2 years, where i did general support, wiring and setups of _Windows NT 4_ networks. Although i was a weird jump as a software developer, i still reap the benefits from this period.

But the "itch" remained, i talked to my manager and convinced him to give me a position as a _Visual Basic_ developer in his _Visual FoxPro_ shop. How i did this will forever remain a mystery. Not so much later, .Net Framework popped up. After a quick conversion course, and lots of head scratching, i was building applications in _Visual Basic .NET_.

About 2 years and a drink with an ex-colleague later, i got really excited about a company he was working for. The company had a music management system that was built in _FileMaker Pro_. Due the fact that _FileMaker_ apps where single file databases and huge amount of data, the system got to slow and needed a rework. After a lot of talks and discussions about the initial architecture, i decided to come onboard.

The things that convinced me were:

- Automatic ripping from cd's, storage in lossless format
- On demand transcoding to mp3 (also tagging with db stored metadata)
- Streaming, so that music manager could enrich the metadata with genre, quality, vibe etc
- Fully automated composition of cd-rom, tailored to the clients wishes
- Automation of burn robot

On the initial launch i've made an error to start the process with a pool of 12 concurrent threads, which totally consumed the cpu power of most of the servers, so we need to completely restart the entire process. I configured the pools to only use 4 threads and 5 minutes later the first cd-roms where getting burned. 

There was no going back anymore as the initial data conversion from _FileMaker_ to _SQL Server_ took the entire weekend. I supported and improved the system for about 1 year. During the time that company was taken over by a bigger fish in the market and i decided it was time to move on.

I started out in 1999 as a _Visual Basic for Applications_ developer. After my studies didn't went as expected, i started developing application. This was on the edge of the **Y2K** bug.

After the initial _'grooming'_, i quickly realized that developing _VBA_ applications wasn't really my thing and decided to move on.

After a surprising job interview, i was hired as a support/network engineer. After some courses and training, i've maintained networks for about 2 years. Did wiring and setup of Windows NT 4 networks. By supporting different clients by telephone or on-site, my communication skills evolved quickly.

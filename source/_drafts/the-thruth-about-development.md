After a career of 2 decades as a professional developer, i wanted to share my point of view to everyone who is interested.

During my career, i've always felt like a lone wolf. I seem incapable of thinking like everyone else. Things like CQRS, Layered architectures, SOA's, micro-whatevers make my stomach turn. Don't get me wrong i've been there too.

But somehow i started to value **simplicity**, **readability** and the **ability to change** more.

The secret to that is something we all know for a long time now. We need to start to do what we've been pretending to do. Write tests, don't just say you write them. Learn to write them in a way so that they give you assurance. Usually mocking a lot of your code, will only make them brittle.
